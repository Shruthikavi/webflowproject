        <p>Oil and gas engineering refers to the design, implementation and operation of technical processes focused
        on the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Once oil and gas are discovered, oil and gas 
        engineers become involved in the process of extracting these resources from reservoirs, often working with 
        specialists such as geoscientists to understand the underlying rock formation, determine the best drilling 
        methods and to monitor daily operations.Oil and gas engineering helps energy companies find and extract oil 
        and gas resources more efficiently, safely and sustainably. As such, oil and gas engineers evaluate energy 
        reservoirs to help predict their profitability and examine potential drilling sites to plan efficient and 
        safe drilling methods needed to recover energy assets.</p>

        <p>I love the sound of rain and the smell of sodden earth. It's also very beautiful to see the rain 
        splattering on rooftops. Sometimes you can see raindrops trickling down the fresh green leaves. Raindrops 
        on window panes shine like tiny golden beads when light falls on them.Rain is liquid precipitation: water falling
        from the sky. Raindrops fall to Earth when clouds become saturated, or filled, with water droplets. Millions of 
        water droplets bump into each other as they gather in a cloud. When a small water droplet bumps into a bigger one,
        it condenses, or combines, with the larger one.</p>

            <p>Diamonds were formed long before <mark>dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and some are even older</mark> than the stars. 
            The youngest diamond <strong>is nearly a billion years old. Diamonds are the hardest natural</strong> substance known to 
            man. They are 58 times <del>harder than the next hardest mineral on Earth.Part of the</del> reason diamonds are held
            in such high <em>esteem is likely because of the gemstone's unique origins and properties.</em> Formed under 
            extremely high heat and pressure, diamonds are one of the hardest materials known in the world.</p>
