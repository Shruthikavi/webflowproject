                    <h2>A bud is a flower that has not bloomed yet or a leaf that will soon unfurl. 
                        Winter buds hold all the potential of spring in small, gift-wrapped packages.</h2>
                    <p>As a flower moves through its life, it transitions between forms. One of the early stages 
                    of a flower's life is when it is still in bud. This is when the stem may be fully grown, but the 
                    flower itself is still tightly wrapped up and not yet blossoming.</p>
